Attending Stanford Treehacks 2024. Our hackathon [project](https://devpost.com/software/instant-gram-social-media-content-generator) eventually morphed into [StoryEngine](https://www.exitstack.co/posts/story-engine-raises-us-750k-from-andreessen-horowitz-to-develop-ai-powered-fantasy-creation-platform) ($750k pre-seed backed by A16z). Note: I am not affiliated with StoryEngine (all credit goes to my hackathon teammate Wanrong He).
