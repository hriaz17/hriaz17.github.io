I am a PhD student at the University of Arizona, advised by Professor [Mihai Surdeanu] (https://surdeanu.cs.arizona.edu/mihai/). My primary area of interest is the faithfulness and causality of reasoning in Large Language Models. My approach to this consists of the following two strategies: integrating knowledge from symbolic reasoners internally in LLMs via reward modeling, and generating synthetic reward feedback data using weak supervision techniques. I have worked on meta-algorithms for synthetic data generation, incorporating causal reasoning and pragamtics into retrieval augmented generation (RAG) frameworks as a downstream application of my research area and exploiting linguistic hints as weak supervision for the NER task.

Recently I completed my internship at Amazon Web Services, where I was an Applied Scientist Intern on the Amazon Science Bedrock team. I worked on an agentic meta-approach for formally diverse synthetic data generation which can be used to adapt LLMs to specific domains requiring only a small amount of synthetic data and without using any real data. This work resulted in a paper currently under review @ ACL 2025.

Before joining the UofA, I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://seecs.nust.edu.pk) at the [National University of Sciences and Technology](https://nust.edu.pk) in 2021.

Besides work, I am learning to play the guitar. I enjoy rock climbing and hiking along the various trails surrounding Tucson. A long time ago, I memorized the spelling of every word in the English dictionary and was a finalist in the 4th Dawn in Education National Spelling Bee.
